    review: "Awesome job! Deck Masters built a custom deck on the back of our house where we previously had only a small set of stairs. The deck was of very high quality construction, and classic wood appeal. The team was professional in all aspects of the deck construction from the quote/communication hiccup during the process, but Jordan was very quick to respond and work through any concerns. I believe Deck Masters truly wants their clients to be completely satisfied with their work and the decks they build... which we are! Would definitely recommend Deck Masters to those in the market for a new deck!"

    review: "We ordered and also resized a few windows (Deck Masters, I contacted Jordan Webb or Sean/Resizing Two Windows). My husband handled most of the interaction but the scanning was quick and was checked almost immediately. Response regarding a meeting at the house so he could give a feel for exactly what we would like to have done. No other builder responded as fast nor did they show the willingness to fit us in. Other companies said they didn't need to visit for the headlines to say. I wasn't comfortable with that. My main idea for the deck was not 100% standard but Jordan explained what would happen and what we could expect. It was that way through the whole build. Pretty much everything about old airways was removed and hauled away, they found some water damage under the vinyl siding which wasn't fully unexpected (problem area and one neither could fix if I wanted it done). They also did some soffit and explained that it was old work. The deck looks fantastic and fits perfectly in the space."

    review: "Jordan & his crew did an absolutely amazing job, & the craftsmanship is second to none. They transformed our entrance porch & made it look seamless per their construction process... They went above and beyond what we asked for & couldn't be happier with our new decks. We will absolutely use them for any projects in the future! Jordan made sure to verify availability for questions answered. Very professional & friendly too to do business with. Will be seeing their use again for future builds for sure. Same below \"before & after\" pictures of the decks so you can see the difference in quality & craftsmanship for yourselves. Thank You Jordan & the Crew, you guys rock!!"

    review: "I hired Jordan, Seamus and team at Deck Masters for the building of our new deck. Had with them as they updated my deck. They came out looked at the damage, formulated a plan and went to work. Despite the February weather they quickly removed all of the rotting broken decking and supports without asking. Throughout the repair process. Why they were doing what and why it was being done that way. The new wood that went into place was better, safer, easy going wood. The mess was cleaned up and the job was finished in just two days. I also want to thank Joelle for putting up with my phone calls. She kept me posted as to my progress on the wait list. She was always polite and upbeat... THANKS TO ALL WHO HELPED!! MESSY!!"

             <ReviewCard name="SHERRI MULRANEY" review="So bids from multiple companies but Jordan came out and made us comfortable with the project plan & price/cost. Getting that out done down to 'a minute of our time' as we like fast and detailed projects wrapped up in 2 weeks. From Joelle in the office to Jeff our onsite foreman, everyone was professional and really easy to work with." />
             <ReviewCard name="ANDREW NEUERBURG" review="We had damage to our deck railing during a big wind storm. Deck Masters was able to remove the old railing and install a new, sturdier railing in a timely fashion. We now have put in because the summer wasn't long started and has had no issue in the winter. Extremely pleased with the craftsmanship of Sean, Robert and Jeff. They were fast, friendly and skilled. Would recommend Deck Masters to anyone looking for quality work." />
             <ReviewCard name="JACKIE SLAGLE" review="We hired Deck Masters for a small project and they did a fantastic job! We had a deadline for the completion date and Robert worked all weekend to ensure that we got it done as soon as possible. I would highly recommend this company to anyone looking for a reliable contractor and does very good work!" />
             <ReviewCard name="DYLAN WEBB" review="This process started amazingly with an incredibly prompt and professional bid. We faced challenges with scheduling our deck construction (as ended up having the build about 8 months after we started) and also had some major issues along the way with miscommunication on design features that we were told during the initial bid that we had to navigate past. However, I gave this company 5 stars because as soon as these issues were brought to Jordan's attention, he always complied in a professional and timely manner to get it done to our liking. I would recommend this service to others." />
